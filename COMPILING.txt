Compile Notes
=============

The Redland Objective-C bindings are developed and tested with Xcode 2.1 under Mac OS X 10.4. The Redland C library and headers must be installed on your system prior to compiling these bindings.

Before compiling, be sure to tell Xcode where it can find the Redland library and its headers:

1. Open the Xcode Preferences -> Source Trees.
2. Add a new path with the setting name "REDLAND_PREFIX", the display name "Redland Prefix", and the path set to the prefix directory of your Redland installation. (In my case, this is "/usr/local/redland", but the default when configuring the Redland source is "/usr/local".)
