First Step
----------

This project contains a script that downloads and compiles raptor2, rasqal and librdf, the components you need. Just choose the **Build C Library** target and
hit **Run**. Compiling requires `pkg-config` which you can most easily install via [Homebrew][]: `brew install pkg-config`
